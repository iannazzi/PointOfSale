multi user application:

someone signs up... we need a unique account name.
that name gets assigned a unique number.
this goes in a system database

user goes to login page. Login page includes the system administration database
login asks for company, user, password
company will typically be prepoulated
company gets set in a cookie.

the company is looked up in the database to find the account key.
if that is sucessful the code 
		-includes the correct config file 
		- or returns an array of db_user/password?
		-sets $_SESSION['ACCOUNT_KEY']
Then user/password is looked up in the account database

then when accessing, the code:
checks system_status.... a file we create for issues... like upgrades, server down. 
checks $_SESSION['account_key']
includes the correct config file (try to make path independent)
checks user as normal


to shut the system down we would need to modify a value somewhere????
index.php has to look up the correct config file


User now logs in with user company

config file stored above public_html. can be folder/file both named by the account.
	-DB Username
	-DB Password
	Encryption salt - pregenerated? yes
	account_key
	account_status - locked etc....
	
In the database we would then need

	code version using ... no/yes? databases automatically upgrade when we release them.

then in public_html we would have 	CraigsCode
										CC_VERSION_2015_04_02.1
											UPGRADE_PATH?
											ENGINE
											3rdParty
											index.php
										CC_VERSION_2015_05_02.1
										CC_VERSION_2015_05_02.2
									CraigsAdminCode
										CC_DATABASE
											CC_DB_VERSION_2015_04_02.1
											CC_DB_VERSION_2015_05_02.1
										SYSTEM_DATABASE
											SY_DB_VERSION_etc
										SYSTEM_CODE
											SY_VERSION_etc
									ACCOUNTS	
										ACCOUNT_NAME
											DATAFILES
												IMAGES
												PRINTQUEUE
											BACKUPS
									
THE SYSTEM DATABASE has a table
account account_name account status account key database name database password

These values get written to the config file so the po_users
